# [Shoply Store](https://the-shoply-store.vercel.app/)

## Overview

This is a final project for two courses of Platzi. The first one: [React course with Vite and Tailwind CSS](https://platzi.com/cursos/react-vite-tailwindcss/) and the second one: [Technical Test: Professional E-commerce with React.js](https://platzi.com/cursos/laboratorio-react/)

### Description

Shoply Store is a web application that allows you to browse and buy streetwear fashion items easily and conveniently. The website is inspire in the official [Figma Store e-commerce](https://render.com/https://store.figma.com/).

The application was developed using React, Vite.js, Tailwind and instead of using the [ Fake API from Platzi](https://fakeapi.platzi.com/) I create my own using [Render](https://render.com/).

The site's design is fully responsive, meaning that it adapts optimally to different screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience on mobile devices, tablets and desktop computers.

## Features

- Fully responsive.
- Add and remove items to your shopping cart.
- Search for items by name.
- Filter items by category.
- Home page with a carousel that highlight products.
- Access detailed product descriptions.
- Create and view your orders in the "My Orders" section.
- My account section.
- Private and public paths for a secure experience.
- Loading spinner for correct data load.

## Objectives

<ol>
  <li>
<b>Integration of an API</b>: An API was implemented to simulate the collection of product data, which allowed creating a realistic and dynamic shopping experience.  </li>
  <li>
   <li>
<b>Use of conditional rendering</b>: I used conditional rendering in React to correctly apply the necessary structure and styles for each type of screen. </li>
  <li>
<b>State and Context Management</b>: The concept of state was used and several global contexts were created for using across all the website.  </li>
  <li>
<b>Private and public routes</b>: Using authentication contexts, private and public routes were established. Users can only access certain sections of the application after logging in, ensuring data security and protection.  </li>
  <li>
<b>Shopping cart functionalities</b>: The ability to add products to the shopping cart, view and search for products, and group them by category was implemented. This improved the shopping experience for users and allowed them to browse and purchase products efficiently.  </li>
  <li>
<b>Use of localStorage</b>: localStorage was used to store login and order creation information. This ensures that users can access and review their orders when they log in.  </li>
  </ol>
